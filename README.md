# Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Download the Repository**: Click on the `Code` button on the repository page and select `Download ZIP`. Save the zip file to your desired location.

2. **Extract the ZIP File**: Navigate to the location where you saved the zip file and extract it.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal in the root directory of the extracted files and run the command to install dependencies. The command will depend on the project setup. For example, if it's a Node.js project, you would run `npm install`.

4. **Copy Reusable Files**: Find the reusable files in the `library` folder. Copy these files and place them in their designated locations in your project.

5. **Delete the Library Folder**: This step is optional. If you no longer need the `library` folder, you can delete it.

Please note that the specific commands and steps may vary depending on your development environment and project setup.
